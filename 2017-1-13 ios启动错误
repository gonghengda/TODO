solution:
Have you checked that you declared a bundle identifier? 
You can do this by Clicking on your project file in xcode and then selecting the general tab 
and it is listed under the first text box under "Identity".
Another way to check is to check in your info.plist file in the ios folder of your project.
This is how it shows in my info.plist. My actual bundle identifier for my project is in xcode.

此错误release启动出现
将下面的代码放入 
<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)</string>
